The user is presented with a simple page design which includes a text field where the password will be pinted. when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are presented with a series of prompts, the results of which determine the character set and length of the password to be generated. 

The user must select at least one of the character set options and must also enter a number between 8 and 128. If either of these conditions are not met, the page will reload and the user will have to start over. The user will be given a second chance to enter a number between 8 and 128 before the page reloads.
